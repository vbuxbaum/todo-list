# FastAPI To-do List

## Brief Explanation of Each Component

- `todo_list/` is the Python package for your to-do list application.
- `todo_list/api/` is where you define the FastAPI routes for your to-do list API.
- `todo_list/core/` is where you define the business logic and entities of your to-do list application. This includes the `models.py` file where you define the data models for your to-do list items and the `services.py` file where you define the service functions that interact with the database.
- `todo_list/infrastructure/` is where you define the low-level details for your to-do list application, such as the database connection. In this example, it contains a single `database.py` file, but you can add more files as needed.
- `todo_list/tests/` is where you keep the test files for your to-do list application.
- `setup.py` is the file used to package and distribute your to-do list application.
- `main.py` is the entry point for your to-do list application.

This is just one possible structure for a clean architecture for a simple to-do list application with FastAPI. You can customize it to fit your specific requirements and add more components as needed.
